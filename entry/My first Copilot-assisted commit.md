I didn't even realize I was being helped. I didn't even realize I needed help.

But CoClippy was still there for me, at the GitHub UI, which I never use.
Only, it wasn't decent enough to add a `#` in front of its own fucking placeholder
text (`Add update note about the blog status`), so if your brain is like mine,
filtering out such noise automatically as a core mental-hygiene feature, then
it'll just end up in the commit message, as in my unsuspecting very first one
here with ClippyBot infiltrating my vegetataive processes (honestly though, as
a sleep-deprived AD(H)D patient, I was easy prey for Copilot):

    Do I still not have a blog?

    Add update note about the blog status
