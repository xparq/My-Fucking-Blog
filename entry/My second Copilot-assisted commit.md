OMG... I just realized that in [My first Copilot-assisted commit](My%20first%20Copilot-assisted%20commit.md) it wasn't even *placeholder* text! :-o

It *was* the real suggested final message... It was so bad that even after

- my brain filtered it out as noise
- and then I saw it making its glorious way into the commit history
- and writing an entire pissed-off post about it

I *still* couldn't interpret it as anything else but a placeholder...

I had to

- start another commit
- see the autogenerated junk materializing in the message box again
- mock it in that same commit message (for self-therapeutic purposes)
- submit, and see it "ratified" in the history

*...only then* did I realize that these are not placeholders at all.
These are the culmination of the *entire* history of technology
development.

I need more sleep to survive this.
