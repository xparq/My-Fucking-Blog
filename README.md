# My Fucking Blog

I still don't have a blog.

**UPDATE:** Now I kinda do then?


----

### Here's how you can read this blog:

- #### In chronological order: follow the [commit history...](https://github.com/xparq/My-Fucking-Blog/commits/)

  - Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't currently let us control the order, so
    it's always: newest first. (Can't reverse it to follow from old to new.)
  - Open a particular commit (by clicking its title), and then see the Files
    pane (tree view) on the left: it's the file under the `entry` node that was
    added by that commit (usually). Click it — that should bring its diff section heading
    into view (if it hasn't yet been there).
  - Under the `[...]` menu at the diff section heading there's a `View file` link.
    Click it to finally arrive to the blog post.
  - Congratulations! You're now enjoying a blog post!

  Of course, not all commits are clearly related to one entry they added,
  so you may hit a more complex case occasionally.

  - Congratulations! You're now enjoying a puzzle, disguised as a blog disguised as a GitHub repo!

- #### In random "just browsing" order:

  - Go to the [entry](https://github.com/xparq/My-Fucking-Blog/tree/main/entry) directory.
  - Just browse.
  - Congratulations! You're now just browsing! What a place! What a palace of exuberant offerings..., huh?!
